🔍 Project Overview
Provide a brief description of the project, including its purpose and vision. This section should give a high-level summary of what the prototype will achieve and why it's being developed.

🎯 Goals & Objectives
List the main goals of the prototype, outlining key problems it aims to solve and expected outcomes. These can be divided into:

🔹 Short-term Goals (early-stage objectives)

🔹 Long-term Vision (scalability, future integrations, expansions)

🛠️ Core Features & Modules
Break down the anticipated features and components. This can be structured as:

Feature Name: Short description of the functionality

Module Name: What purpose it serves in the system

Status: Prototype phase, planned, in progress

📂 File Structure & Architecture
Provide a high-level directory structure showing how the codebase is organized. Example:

plaintext
/project-root
│── /src                  # Main source files
│── /docs                 # Documentation & guides
│── /config               # Configuration files
│── /public               # Static assets (images, fonts)
│── /tests                # Unit & integration tests
│── README.md             # Project documentation
│── .gitignore            # Git tracking rules
│── package.json          # Dependencies & scripts
🖼️ UI/UX Wireframes & Design Approach
Placeholder for design decisions, wireframes, and UI principles to be followed in the prototype development.

🚀 Development Workflow
Outline the steps for development, including:

🔹 Setup Instructions (installing dependencies, configuring environment)

🔹 Branching Strategy (how the repository should be managed)

🔹 Testing Procedures (unit/integration testing guidelines)

🔹 Deployment Approach (if applicable for early testing)

📝 Contribution Guidelines
